Installing on Render
====================

Render is a web hosting platform, similar to Heroku. Support for deploying Tabbycat to Render is currently **very experimental**. Please note:

- Render provides a similar '1 click' method as to Heroku; e.g. it should be approachable to people without experience in deploying web applications
- Although Tabbycat is setup on the free-tiers of Render, you may need to add a credit card to your account in order to deploy Tabbycat
- Tabbycat's performance on Render is not optimised. Don't use render if you are going to have lots of people accessing your tab site
- Render's free-tier database will **stop working and delete all your data** after 90 days. If you want to keep your tab data around for the long term, you must backup your data and host it elsewhere after the tournament ends
- Some Tabbycat functionality may not work
- Email-related functionality will definitely not work
- These instructions are provisional drafts
